# Upplev skogen

Upplev skogen is only a landingpage that I build early in my studies to frontend developer.
I like to use the new knowledge in live project, rather then just practicing coding.

The nature is close to my heart, and I like to walk around to reflect and see all the history that is scathered around in my surrounding.
So tried to make an page that I would like to visit.

Very simple and no functions. Didn't know how to wright javascript at this point.
