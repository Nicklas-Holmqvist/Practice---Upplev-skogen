# Upplev skogen

Upplev skogen is only a landingpage that I build early in my studies to frontend developer.
I like to use the new knowledge in live project, rather then just practicing coding.

The nature is close to my heart, and I like to walk around to reflect and see all the history that is scathered around in my surrounding.
